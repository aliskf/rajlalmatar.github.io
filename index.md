## Summary

I combine industry experience with academia, currently serving as a Lecturer in Computer Science at Al-Shamal Private University while continuing to advance machine learning applications across diverse domains—from medical diagnostics to data compression and beyond.

As a lecturer, I teach undergraduate courses in Informatics Engineering, develop curriculum materials, supervise student projects and research, and contribute to academic activities. Previously working as a Data Scientist in Dubai, I specialized in end-to-end machine learning workflows: collecting and preprocessing large datasets, building predictive models, and translating insights into actionable business strategies.

My technical toolkit includes Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, with hands-on experience in classification, regression, clustering, and deep learning architectures. I hold an MSc in Computer Science Engineering from Akdeniz University, where my thesis explored Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) for image compression.
